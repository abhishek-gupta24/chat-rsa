> ## ChatRSA v0.1 ##

> ChatRSA is a software which provides automatic RSA encryption/decryption messages in a simple safe chat box.


> ### How it works? ###

> Once established the connection from cliente to server, Private and Public Keys are generated on both users with the actual best criptography algorithm, RSA, then Public Keys are sent each other.

> User A encrypts and send messages with user B Public Key, so do user B with user A Public Key.
> They can then decrypt the received messages with their own Private Keys.

> Even intercepted messages can't be read or undestood outside the chat box.
